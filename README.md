# Teckentranskription

Playing around with transcription of Swedish sign language inspired an essay by
Brita Bergman and Thomas Björkstrand’s “[Teckentranskription]” (at Department
of Linguistics, Stockholm University, 2015).

Also I was struck by the realisation that a sign language dictionary was based
on sign transcription (rather than a video recording for each sign – an
approached used, for example, by [Svenskt Teckenspråkslexikon]) it would be
possible to:

1. Fit an entire dictionary, e.g. on a cell phone. (Offline use!)
2. Search for a word based on how it is signed.

If (2) is achievable (it might not, if it turns out that the Swedish sign
language transcription system used isn’t narrow enough to lend itself to
accurate animation) it would be especially cool to have an interface that
allows the user to transcribe a sign, while having a real time update animation
of what the currently entered sign looks like.
