* [1/2] Simple articulation field
** TODO Move 'medial contact'(?) and 'contact' symbols to separator
   'Medial contact' and 'contact' are dots and therefore narrower and would go
   better with the separator button (for typographical reasons).

   Is 'medial contact' meant to be wider? I.e. have space on each sides? If so,
   retain it where it currently is.
** DONE Three buttons

   symbol, but upside down) which is centered better.
** TODO "Läge – Ögat" should be lowered
