* TODO Shortcuts for hand shape glyphs
  Pressing an alphabetic key should jump to the glyph most similar i
  appearance = Faster navigation!
* TODO Focusing glyph should update status box
  Displaying the information about that glyph.
* TODO Resize image bounding boxes
  The size of each image should be just enough for the glyph to fit, and then
  each image should be included in the DOM not as background images using CSS,
  but as proper images with the <img> tag -- that way the HTML tables can
  adjust automatically to each glyph's size and we'll get a (much?) prettier
  layout of each transcribed sign.
* TODO Delete function
  For erasing a saved transcription.
* TODO 'Clear' button
  For clearing the current transcription.
* TODO Import/export saved data
* [1/2] Simple articulation field
** TODO Move 'medial contact'(?) and 'contact' symbols to separator
   'Medial contact' and 'contact' are dots and therefore narrower and would go
   better with the separator button (for typographical reasons).

   Is 'medial contact' meant to be wider? I.e. have space on each sides? If so,
   retain it where it currently is.
** DONE Three buttons

* [6/9] Fix bad/missing glyphs
** TODO What to do with the (so far) unused glyphs?
   Files matching `pic/**/*Truetrans*.svg`.
** TODO "Läge – Höfterna" is to wide
   pic/six_Truetrans1.svg

   Compare this with "Läge – Axlarna" [pic/greater_Truetrans1.svg] (same
   symbol, but upside down) which is centered better.
** TODO "Handform – Krokfingret" should have thicker lines
   Currently this glyph has thinner lines than all the other glyphs. That
   doesn't look nice. :(
** DONE "Läge – Ögat" should be lowered

  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 03:40]
  The I type buttons should add their symbol at the beginning of the
  transcript, rather than at the end.
* [7/7] Give glyph SVG files descriptive names
  Instead of the pseudo-random names they inherited from the typefaces.

* DONE 'Interaction kind' component of IIa should be optional
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 11:19]
  Double articulation cluster IIa should have an optional interaction kind.
* DONE Hand position glyphs should rotate clockwards
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 20:34]
  'AR' and 'AV' glyphs should be reordered so that they rotate clockwards as
  one steps through them.
* DONE Display optional 'interaction kind' component of IIa better
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 12:03]
  It should only take up space in the glyph when it is actually used.
* DONE Remember last saved
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 22:33]
  On reload, the transcription loaded before the reload should be the one
  displayed.
* DONE Named saves
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 14:44]
  Should allow for saving of multiple transcriptions with different names, so
  that we can transcribe a buncha stuff and see what works.
