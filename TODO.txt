** [1/12] Query syntax
*** TODO Help section for query syntax
    * = match 'word' characters (i.e. not space and segment separator, '􌥠', but
      everything else)

    Useful (complex) query:
    􌥧 􌦆􌥃 -􌥠 -#:#: -:##: -􌦆*􌦆  -@

    Transcriptions are fiddly and finicky, rather than spending time on
    inputting a transcription, search for a sign that you know is similar to
    the one you're looking for, then copy/paste the transcription of that sign
    into the search field and replace parts you're not sure about with
    asterisks ('*').

    If you get too many matches, the following search terms can be useful for
    ignoring some of them:

      -:##: -- exclude signs with two active hands
      -#:#: -- exclude signs with one active, one passive hand
      -@    -- exclude signs a body position
      -􌥠    -- exclude signs with more than one segment
      -􌥠*􌥠  -- exclude signs with more than two segments
      :##:  -- include only signs with two active hands
      #:#:  -- include only signs with one active, one passive hand
      @     -- include only signs which have a body position

    Display signs that contain a downward motion, and a handshape transition to
    the spread hand (sprethanden), but that does not contain multiple segments
    (-􌥠), two handed segments (excluding those with a passive secondary hand
    with -#:#:, and those with an active secondary hand with -:##:), more than
    one handshape transition, or a specified position (-@).
*** TODO Specify match is to be all in one segment
    Add a prefix to specify that a match should be all within the same segment.
    (Maybe 'x:'?)

    This would mean that a query like '*􌤶##:' cannot match across segment
    borders.

    In practice this means that in fields with this prefix, an asterisk ('*')
    should match '[^/]*' (where '/' is the segment separator) instead of '.*'.
*** TODO New search query syntax (require '*' for partial words)
    There should also be a help section for the new special characters, and if a
    search resulted in zero matches, something helpful should be displayed to
    the user.
*** TODO Don't use '#' for special stuff in search queries
    It is used in the transcriptions to indicate finger spelled words.
*** TODO Character class for 'förs'
    All arrows, not including 'contact'.
*** TODO Character class for 'circle'
    Old + new circle symbols
*** TODO Character class for 'face'
    Combination of upper and lower face.
*** TODO Character class for 'upper face'
    Upper/whole face + upper & central facial features (crown, forhead, eye) etc.
*** TODO Character class for 'lower face'
    Lower/whole face + lower & central facial features (cheek, chin, mouth) etc.
*** TODO Character class for 'hand-external type of motion'
    Curving, (all types of) circling, hitting and turning.
*** TODO Character classes [...] to search query
    Useful when one is searching for one of multiple hand shapes.

** TODO Add symbols from Riemer 2015
** TODO # links should auto-uncollapse sections
   If one visits to a link that contain a # part in the intro article, the the
   page should automatically unfold that part and go there.
** TODO Explain relation symbols better
   Include an image explaining the relation symbols in better detail.

   What are they in relation to? How do they relate to the body of the signer?
   This came up in discussion with Thomas Björkstrand, who argued that 'in
   front of' symbol could be interpreted in relation to the attitude of passive
   hand, while I argued that is is about the location of the two hand in
   relation to the body.
** TODO In symbol lists
   Make deprecated symbols striped red by default.

** TODO Search function
   Javascript search function that automatically unfolds the relevant/matching
   sections.

   One unanswered question: Can we search in the DOM for text that is present
   in hidden <details> sections? Or is that text not present in the DOM because
   the element is hidden?

   Article on how to do this:
   https://j11y.io/javascript/replacing-text-in-the-dom-solved/

   Maybe using this:
   https://github.com/padolsey/findAndReplaceDOMText/blob/master/src/findAndReplaceDOMText.js


   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32783336/find-text-in-source-code-of-page-and-create-hyperlink
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker

   It would be cool if just the browser-native search function automatically
   opened up the relevant section when you searched... But interacting with the
   browser search function seems to be highly idiomatic in different browsers,
   and not worth the effort.
** TODO Put all footnote texts inside <aside> tags
** TODO Lone tables should not be in <figure> tags
   Tables that are the only content in a <figure> tag should use their own
   <caption>, and not need the surrounding <figure>.

   Adapt CSS for this scenario, then remove the unnecessary <figure> tags.
** TODO Frequency table of attitude combinations
   A table like the one in Bergman (1977) p.51, but with a 'heat map' of
   combination occurrences. (Both with percentages and greyscale[?] background
   colors illustrating which combinations are the most common.)
** TODO Transcription problem: Contact point
   http://localhost/teckentranskription/lexicon.html#02993%2C08968

   'To mean' and 'happening' look very similar in transcription, but they make
   contact in very different places. How does the reader know where contact is
   made? (Is there a rule of some kind? -- Or does the transcription need some
   way of specifying the contact point?)

   Kankkonen (2015) has a way of describing 'contact' point.
** TODO Ponder replacing 'toward' and 'away from' with converge/diverge
   Explore/ponder/research the fact that the modifier symbols '--> <--' and
   '<-- -->' (which are written under circling, curving, hitting, twisting)
   could maybe be better written with converging and diverging symbols
   underneath the symbol it modifies.
** [0/4] Table filtering
*** TODO Go through handshape symbols in 'my' lexicon
    To verify which handshapes are actually used in the web lexicon.
*** TODO Add missing symbols from 1994 source to position table
    Duplicated symbols are not listed in the book appendix (except for the
    chest). Go through the transcriptions in the book and include the missing
    symbols: the eyes, ears, cheeks, shoulders and/or hips.

    Also look for left ear, cheek or hip, and include those as well (if they
    exist in the book).
*** TODO Add source info for position table
*** TODO Add source info for articulation table
** TODO Reference section should which sources are derivatives of other
   There should be comments describing that the following works are basically
   variations on *the exact the same text*, with only some minor updates. (This
   is especially important almost all of the example transcriptions given are
   retained, even though many of them are no longer to be found in the
   lexicon.)

** TODO All mentions of a reference should link to relevant reference section
** TODO Standardize citing of sources
   Everywhere where a source is quoted, it should be done using a <details>
   tag, with name + page of source in the <summary>. E.g.:

     <details closed>
       <summary>[<a href="#ref1977">Tecknad svenska</a>]</summary>

       <p>.....

** TODO Add symbol descriptions from "Kompendium in teckenspråkstranskription"
   Symbols for "lilla A-handen" etc. that occur in this source should be
   included in the article.
** TODO Include transcription of words especially interesting words
   'camera' makes use of passive + active hand + body position. That this can
   occur (and how) should be described in the transcription rules somehow.
   http://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/ord/03672

   'setback' (få tji/få bakslag) is singed in an odd way, and the passive hand
   sort of has a body position, but the sign isn't transcribed that way in the
   lexicon: http://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/ord/00497 -- Is there even a way
   to understand the sign from the current transcription in the lexicon?
** TODO Prettier positioning of the hand images in the handshape table
   The handshape images in the table of handshapes should not be in separate
   <td>, but should instead be floated left, so that the description text of
   the handshape in question can fill out the entire width of the column (right
   now the text column becomes very narrow when there are multiple hand shapes
   show on the right hand side of the text).
** TODO Source citations (<details>) should be more clearly delineated
   Currently is kinda hard to see difference between an expanded source
   citation and the surrounding text, maybe put a border or something around
   it?
** TODO Improve top-right expand/collapse buttons
   Instead of having two buttons, there should be only one which should (in a
   fashion similar to org-mode) cycle through the modes:

     + Everything collapsed (default)
     + All <details> without the 'closed' attribute opened
     + ALL <details> opened

   Mouseover text should clearly state what will happen upon the next click.

    elsewhere.)
*** TODO Add symbol 'repeated signeme' (1977)
    Only used in Bergman (1977), example given on page 129. – Looks like a

*** TODO Add symbol 'angled rooster hand' (1989)
    Only used in Hedberg (1989). – Looks like the 'straight measure hand', with

*** DONE Use dropdown for table filtering

*** DONE Number of entries shown should be displayed at top of table
    CLOSED: [2018-03-06 Tue 19:45]
    So that you can easily see e.g. how many handshapes occurred in a specific
    source.
*** DONE Fix table checkboxes
    CLOSED: [2018-03-06 Tue 19:45]
    One should be able to use the table checkboxes for selecting what to
    display in any given table.

    These should work so that, when checked, all items with that attribute are
    displayed (but no other).

    If multiple checkboxes are marked, they should be AND:ed together.

   CLOSED: [2018-01-21 Sun 02:07]
   Something matching the current color theme, rather than the currently blue

   CLOSED: [2018-01-18 Thu 17:45]
** DONE Virtual keyboard should not rely on HTML
   CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 06:40]
   All the HTML, CSS etc. should be in self-contained Javascript module.
** DONE Virtual keyboard shouldn't respond to Alt-Esc etc.
   CLOSED: [2018-01-07 Sun 12:45]
   Only plain Esc, without qualifier keys, should result in the onscreen
   keyboard being displayed.
** DONE Cleanup variable + function names
   CLOSED: [2018-01-06 Sat 22:22]
   Don't use '_' in function names.

   Replace `searchQuery` with either `queryStr` or just `query`, depending on
   whether it's a parsed object or the user-inputted query string.
** DONE Rewrite query parser
   CLOSED: [2018-01-06 Sat 22:12]
   Query parser now process user-inputted query string character by character,
   instead of parsing it with a regex. This should eliminate the possibility of
   an infinite loop in some undetected corner case.
** DONE Make the Javascript pass JSLint
   CLOSED: [2018-01-06 Sat 08:01]
   Two warnings remain as of now, but these seem quite minor & hard to fix so
   leaving them for now.

   Unexpected '\' before '1'.
       .replace(/^(["'])(.*?)\1?$/u, "$2")           // remove quotes

   Unexpected statement '=' in expression position.
      while (m = termRegex.exec("," + queryStr)) {
** DONE Add links to other articles from lexicon
   CLOSED: [2018-01-05 Fri 10:37]
** DONE Search queries: Comma as OR separator in search query
   CLOSED: [2018-01-04 Thu 17:40]
   Query should be split into OR:ed sub-queries on comma. E.g.
   'X, Y' should search for all words containing either X or Y.
** DONE Search queries: Space as AND separator in search query
   CLOSED: [2018-01-04 Thu 17:40]
   Searching for 'A<space>B' should find lexical entries with both 'A' and 'B'
   in them, regardless of order.
** DONE Scroll to top-of-page widgety thing
   CLOSED: [2018-01-02 Tue 06:06]
   Semi-transparent arrow in lower right corner should appear if scrolling
   down, if pressed it should bring user to top of page.
** DONE Progress bar during search result update
   CLOSED: [2017-12-31 Sun 11:18]
   The search is always very fast, but displaying results takes time when there
   are a lot of entries found... Is there a way to speed this up?

   NO -- I did some research/experiments with various ways of updating the DOM,
   but couldn't find any method that was significantly faster than the one
   currently used.

   Rewrote the updating so a search resulting in 500 matches will be displayed
   is the same way as before, but if there are more matches than that, then
   each additional chunk of 500 matches will be added chuck-by-chunk (with a
   progress bar at the top of the page indicating how many chunks to go).
** DONE Make lexicon search case-insensitive
   CLOSED: [2017-12-25 Mon 01:58]
   Some words in the dictionary have upper case letters in their definition,
   these upper case letters cannot be matched in a search. (Since the query is
   translated to lowercase, and only lower case is searched for.)
** DONE Lexicon: Browser history buttons should work
   CLOSED: [2017-12-12 Tue 13:30]
   Update '#<query>' part of the URL so that back/forward buttons work.

   CLOSED: [2017-09-20 Wed 19:25]
** DONE Pressing <enter> should also update search
   CLOSED: [2017-12-20 Wed 18:43]
   Currently, in MSIE11, pressing <enter> does not execute search (one has to
   unfocus the input field for the search to update).
** DONE Share button should look more like YouTube's share button
