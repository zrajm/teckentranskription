* Browser support
  + Function:  IE9+ (?)  Safari(?)  -- search functionality must work
  + Cosmetics: IE10+     Safari(?)  -- minor difference in appearance is ok

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  + Firefox before version 64 (Dec 2018) will show scrollbars in the textarea.
    On Firefox 'overflow: hidden' suppress scrolling of the <textarea> field
    when user pastes text into it, we therefore use the Firefox-specific
    'scrollbar-width: none' for which support was added by Firefox 64.

      Redrew SVG and optimized it (with a combination of manual methods and

      attribute (not required for inline SVGs).

      + [[https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/][SVGOMG online SVG minifier]]
      + [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill#path][SVG 'fill' attribute defaults]]

      This icon is inlined since it is (a) only used once (in the search form)
      and (b) it is visible on page load.
*** TODO Lexicon/search part should be standalone module
    Module should have methods for returning named entry properties (i.e. the
    ID, transcription, translation etc. of an entry).
*** TODO Use ECMAScript6 or not?
    Currently using /u regex flag, which turns out to be ES6. This program
    probably won't work without it, and thus it might be better to go all the
    way and use `let` and `const` and all the other good stuff from ES6.

    Which browsers support ES6?

    Need to test (get some statistics on what browser ppl have):

    Compatibility data is from here: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

    + ES5 standard released in 2009.
    + ES6 standard released in 2015.

    |-----------------+---------------------|
    | Browser         | /u support          |
    |-----------------+--------+------------|
    | Firefox         | >=v50? | 2016-06-06 |

    If we need to go ES5, then splitting of the query string can be done with
    code found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38901550/351162
** TODO Add autocompletion to search field
   Entering words in the search field should give autocomplete similar to
   Google.

   + Autocomplete textarea

** TODO Make Progressive Web App (PWA)
   This would allow a user to 'install' the lexicon on their phone (regardless
   of OS!).
   + This hides the URL, so probably need a separate share button
** [4/7] New URL syntax
   A syntax to allow for video/text search results + upcoming overlays.
*** TODO Fix help text hash link                                        :BUG:
    There's a URL fragment link '<a href=#fras>se ovan</a>' in the help text.
    Following this link will quietly do a search for 'fras' in the background --
    messing up any previously existing search result.
*** TODO Remove extraneous components in URL
    Eg '/xx' in the URL http://localhost/tsplex/lexicon.html#he/help/xx
    or the multiple '####' in http://localhost/tsplex/lexicon.html####he/help/xx

    This URL cleanup thing could probably reside in getStateFromUrl(). However,
    doing this sort of cleanup would make user *lose* information they've typed
    into the URL bar, and might not be such a good idea?

    Since this modification of the URL would cause an immediate rewrite of the
    URL it shouldn't be stored in the browser history, but the faulty URL should
    simply be replace by the new one using `replaceState()` rather than
    `pushState()`.

    (Except for the video toggle part; cleaning up the number of '########'
    sounds like it would always be good, right?)
*** TODO Overlay by entering in URL
*** TODO Overlay by clicking on Swedish of sign
** [1/9] Query syntax
*** TODO Don't hilite space in front of word in search results
    The edge-of-word matcher shouldn't hilite the space in front of a word.

    Since we cannot use lookahead assertions (its not supported by a majority
    of browsers), we'll prolly need some subgroups to split the match into
    parts-to-be-hilited, and parts-not-to-be-hilited.
*** TODO Alternate hand symbols
    Allow usage of annotation handshape in place of the transcription symbols.
    These are the:

    | A    | A-hand        |
    | Ao   | Tumvinkelhand |
    | B    | Tumhand       |
    | D    | D-hand        |
    | G    | Knuten hand   |
    | ..   | ..            |
    | Jt   | Flat tumhand  |
    | Lbs  | Liten O-hand  |
    | etc. |               |

    Complete table in Wallin & Mesch (2018, s 45)
*** TODO Specify match is to be all in one segment
    Add a prefix to specify that a match should be all within the same segment.
    (Maybe 'x:'?)

    This would mean that a query like '*ô¤¶##:' cannot match across segment
    borders.

    In practice this means that in fields with this prefix, an asterisk ('*')
    should match '[^/]*' (where '/' is the segment separator) instead of '.*'.
*** TODO Character class for 'motion right'
    'move right', 'short motion right' and, 'curving motion right' and 'hit
    right', should all be matched by 'move right'.

    The same goes for 'left', 'forward', 'backward', 'up' and 'down'.
*** TODO Character class for 'fÃ¶rs'
    All arrows, not including 'contact'.
*** TODO Character class for 'circle'
    Old + new circle symbols
*** TODO Character class for 'hand-external type of motion'
    Curving, (all types of) circling, hitting and turning.
*** TODO Character classes [...] to search query
    Useful when one is searching for one of multiple hand shapes.
** [0/3] Search result order
*** TODO Display search result in subquery order
    Returned result should have one list per subquery (and in the same order as
    the subqueries), and the result should be displayed in that order.
*** TODO Sort search result by relevance
    Sorting algorithm:

    + Percentage of field matched

      I.e. if searching for '2' then the matching field '2â2' should get lower
      relevance score than the field '2' (even though '2â2' contains two
      matches, some of the content of the field is not matched by anything).

    + Should content that is matched by '*' in the search query count towards
      relevance? (Count as half?)

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Calculated from how much of the matching field was matched by the search
    query? E.g. if I search for 'hej', this currently gives me the following
    search results (by order in database, <...> marks the matching part):

        00032 ô¤ô¤ºô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¤ô¥¼ô¦ô¥£ <hej>
        01602 ô¤µô¥ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤µô¤¶ô¥µô¥¼ô¥» <hej>a pÃ¥
        05705 ô¤µô¥ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤µô¥ô¦ <hej>are pÃ¥, strong, en baddare pÃ¥
        07895 ô¤´ô¤¸ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤´ô¤¸ô¥°ô¦ô¥¼ô¥» <hej>a pÃ¥
        11736 ô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¦ô¤£ô¥¼ô¥» <hej> dÃ¥
        11770 ô¤ô¤ºô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¤ô¥¼ô¦ô¥£ <hej> dÃ¥
        12747 h-e-j <hej>

    While a relevance-based algorithm should give me the following:

        00032 ô¤ô¤ºô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¤ô¥¼ô¦ô¥£ <hej>
        12747 h-e-j <hej>
        11736 ô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¦ô¤£ô¥¼ô¥» <hej> dÃ¥
        11770 ô¤ô¤ºô¤¢ô¤µô¤·ô¤ô¥¼ô¦ô¥£ <hej> dÃ¥
        01602 ô¤µô¥ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤µô¤¶ô¥µô¥¼ô¥» <hej>a pÃ¥
        07895 ô¤´ô¤¸ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤´ô¤¸ô¥°ô¦ô¥¼ô¥» <hej>a pÃ¥
        05705 ô¤µô¥ô¤¦ô¤¦ô¤µô¥ô¦ <hej>are pÃ¥, strong, en baddare pÃ¥

    Largest match score is assigned to the two entries for which the entire
    field matched. The lesser percentage matching, the further down in the
    results the match comes.

    Eventually other factors should also weigh in, we could for example have a
    score (in the database) for each individual sign, e.g. giving a lower score
    to a less common sign, e.g. fingerspelled versions of signs (like 'h-e-j' in
    list above). (This should be based on frequency data from the corpus.)
*** TODO Sortable search result(?)
    Search result should be sortable in by:

    + Subquery order
    + ID number
    + Sign language transcription (sort order?)
    + Swedish

    Default should be: subquery + sign language.

    Present search result in a sortable table? Should be able to sort by swedish
    word, and by sign language.
** [1/27] GUI
*** TODO Move SVG to CSS? -- Does that work with currentFill?
    (To make HTML form more readable.)
*** TODO Unify :focus marking styles
    There should be two types of focus markers: borders and icons. Menu and
    form icons (clear and keyboard) button should look the same.
*** [1/8] Unify menu & overlay style
    Menu & overlays should have the same look-and-feel. Should this also apply
    to the on-screen keyboard?
**** TODO Use same style for on-screen keyboard(?)
     Ie darken everything all but input form when using the on-screen keyboard?
**** TODO Hover on scrim: Hilite close button
**** TODO Click on scrim: Close menu/overlay
**** TODO Click on close: Close menu/overlay
**** TODO Escape: Close menu/overlay
**** TODO Focus behavior: Keyboard focus should work the same
     The menu/overlay should not be focusable in itself (as the overlay
     currently is), only items inside it.

     One should not be able to focus elements outside the currently opened
     menu/overlay. (Maybe by setting the all tabindexes on the page to negative
     values?)
**** TODO Border: Should be the same
     4px rounded corner? + Textbox shadow?
**** DONE Scrim for both menu and overlay
     CLOSED: [2019-08-25 Sun 21:52]
     Both menu and overlay should have dark scrim outside it. It should look
     the same for both.
*** TODO Rethink/redesign the virtual keyboard
    The virtual keyboard should be replaced with something a bit more
    intuitive. A proper self-explanatory interface for writing sign language
    transcription.

    This should new interface should have dropdown icon (small downwards
    pointing triangle) rather than a keyboard for an icon.
*** TODO Add 'Om lexikonet' menu item
    An info text briefly describing design idea, nature of cooperation with
    'Svenskt teckensprÃ¥kslexikon' and the CC license.

    + Add CC license text + note data source
*** TODO On pageload: Faster selection of fullscreen or normal search
    Currently, if loading the page without a query, first the 'small' version
    of the query is displayed briefly.
*** TODO Show difference between keyboard focus & mouse focus
    When an HTML element is selected via the keyboard use a border to hilite
    it. When hovered over using the mouse pointer use box shadow.

    Make sure both kinds of selections look especially good with the search
    form with text input hilited.
*** TODO Think more about self-explanatory aspect of the GUI
    Are there additional modifications that can be done to better give a new
    user a sense of how to use the search? How to make the transcription search
    feature more self-explanatory for users unaccustomed to the transcription
    system?

    Article on how to make "the perfect search box":
    https://uxplanet.org/design-a-perfect-search-box-b6baaf9599c
*** TODO Use Stackexchange magnifier glass instead of current one?
*** TODO Add virtual keyboard close button
    Add x-button top/right inside the keyboard? Or replace virtual keyboard
    icon with a slashed through keyboard to indicate that it can be used to
    close the virtual keyboard?
*** TODO Display text input caret (cursor) with virtual keyboard
    When the virtual keyboard is shown the caret should always be displayed in
    the search query. This can be done by making sure the text input element is
    always in focus â meaning that clicking on a virtual keyboard key, or using
    tab to navigate around in the keyboard needs be handled "manually" by the
    script.

    Ie, while the virtual keyboard is up, use a class to show the currently
    selected button, and modify that based in tab.
*** TODO Make virtual keyboard come sliding out from under the search form
    The on-screen keyboard should be displayed on top of search results, so
    that dropping the keyboard does not scroll the search results.
*** TODO Make search form drop down on top of search result
    When scrolling down the search form should scroll up with the page, when
    scrolling up it should be immediately revealed -- just like URL bar in the
    mobile browser.
*** TODO Should be able to zoom out on mobile                        :Mobile:
*** TODO Darker URL bar                                              :Mobile:
    The theme-color should be a bit darker to contrast with the search bar.
    (<meta name="theme-color" content="#07bccd">)
*** TODO Narrower page margins on mobile                             :Mobile:
    Especially the search field part should use the full width of the screen.
*** TODO If video load fail, click again to try again                   :BUG:
    Currently, if video fails to load than one have to reload the whole page in
    order to retry loading the video. Clicking a video that failed to load
    should attempt to load it again.
*** TODO Add missing relation symbols when importing(?)
    This is a lexicon, so for clarity, all two-hand descriptions should have a
    relation symbol (in my opinion). We could automatically insert this when
    importing the lexicon.
*** TODO Use browser history 'back' to exit overlays
    This means that using the browser back/forward buttons would scroll through
    the search history in a reasonable manner (without having overlays pop up).

    When exiting an overlay, it should invoke

       window.history.back();

    To remove itself from history.

    This also means, however, that on initial page load with an overlay
    specified in the URL, we first need to load a search page, then display the
    overlay, so that there is something to go back to when exiting the overlay.
*** TODO Does play/pause feedback work in MS browsers?         :TEST:Windows:
*** TODO Does play/pause feedback work in Safari?                  :TEST:Mac:
*** TODO Keyboard navigation
    Arrow keys to navigate between matches
    Up/down/left/right - in video mode.
    Up/down - in text mode.

    Is there a non-Javascript way of doing this?
    * Tab/shift-tab move focus from one video to the next
    * 1234567890 -- move to % percent of matches
    * <space>? display video overlay info
    * key to go to ID/external site
    * key to search for transcription
    * <Esc>(?) key to focus search input area
*** TODO Use lazy loading of images?
*** TODO Multiple <mark> in same entry not working                      :BUG:
    A search for 'â,72,har' should hilite three different things
    in entry 00072, but only the transcription is hilited. Why?
    http://localhost/teckentranskription.lexicon/lexicon.html#otranskr%2C%2072%2C%20har
*** TODO Serve poster images through GitHub page?
        var videoTmpl = "video/{firstDigits}/{file}-{id}-tecken.mp4";
        var imageTmpl = "lexicon/{firstDigits}/{file}-{id}-tecken.jpg";
*** TODO Click on translation to display overlay with all info
    The htmlifyTranscription() function will probably need to insert <wbr>
    each segment separator in the transcript. The following snippet was
    previously used, for this.

        return hilitedTransStr
            // Insert <wbr> tag after all segment separators.
            .replace(/ô¥ /gu, 'ô¥ <wbr>')
*** TODO Make Javascript generated CSS neater
    Instead of using jQuery to apply CSS in 'style' attribute, should generate
    random ID for a prefix, and use CSS rules.
** TODO Link words together                                        :DATABASE:
   Words should be linked together with other words of the same meaning, like
   the following:

   + One / two handed variants â BADA(05245) / BADA(00529)
   + Verbânoun pairs â HETA(02892) / NAMN(02890)
     (Many of these differing only in repetition.)
   + Close-to-synonym â HETA(02892) / KALLAS(07923)

** TODO Transcriptions should be clearly marked
   In text where only one or two single transcription symbols are used it is
   sometimes not very clear what's going on, since the use of transcription is
   not clearly indicated. An obvious fix would be to always circumscribe
   transcriptions with eg [â¦]. (This is prolly not needed in tables & figures,
   but only in the main text.)

   Currently this is pretty inconsistently done, using (â¦) in some parts of the
   text, [â¦] in some, and no indicator at all in some parts.

   Maybe this page can help? It links to `details.js` and also mentions usage
   for styling <details> among people on GitHub.
   http://www.otsukare.info/2016/04/19/summary-details

** TODO New filter hilite color in glyph tables
   The filter hilite should be clearly distinguishable even when the table
   entries are expanded and/or focused.
** TODO Glyph list should all use same casing
   Some tables now have capitalized descriptions, some have lower cased. This
   should be the same everywhere.

   Argument for lowercase: Lowercase is used throughout the wordlist (it might
   make difference for some of the terms). So maybe use lowercase in all
   tables/lists?

** TODO Describe symbols below circling/curving/hitting/twisting
** TODO Add symbols from Riemer 2015
** TODO # links should auto-expand sections
   If one visits to a link that contain a # part in the intro article, the the
   page should automatically unfold that part and go there.
** TODO Explain relation symbols better
   Include an image explaining the relation symbols in better detail.

   What are they in relation to? How do they relate to the body of the signer?
   This came up in discussion with Thomas BjÃ¶rkstrand, who argued that 'in
   front of' symbol could be interpreted in relation to the attitude of passive
   hand, while I argued that is is about the location of the two hand in
   relation to the body.
** TODO In symbol lists
   Make deprecated symbols striped red by default.
   https://css-tricks.com/stripes-css/

** TODO Search function
   Javascript search function that automatically unfolds the relevant/matching
   sections.

   One unanswered question: Can we search in the DOM for text that is present
   in hidden <details> sections? Or is that text not present in the DOM because
   the element is hidden?

   Article on how to do this:
   https://j11y.io/javascript/replacing-text-in-the-dom-solved/

   Maybe using this:
   https://github.com/padolsey/findAndReplaceDOMText/blob/master/src/findAndReplaceDOMText.js


   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32783336/find-text-in-source-code-of-page-and-create-hyperlink
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker

   It would be cool if just the browser-native search function automatically
   opened up the relevant section when you searched... But interacting with the
   browser search function seems to be highly idiomatic in different browsers,
   and not worth the effort.
** TODO Put all footnote texts inside <aside> tags
** TODO Lone tables should not be in <figure> tags
   Tables that are the only content in a <figure> tag should use their own
   <caption>, and not need the surrounding <figure>.

   Adapt CSS for this scenario, then remove the unnecessary <figure> tags.
** TODO Frequency table of attitude combinations
   A table like the one in Bergman (1977) p.51, but with a 'heat map' of
   combination occurrences. (Both with percentages and greyscale[?] background
   colors illustrating which combinations are the most common.)
** TODO Transcription problem: Contact point
   http://localhost/teckentranskription/lexicon.html#02993%2C08968

   'To mean' and 'happening' look very similar in transcription, but they make
   contact in very different places. How does the reader know where contact is
   made? (Is there a rule of some kind? -- Or does the transcription need some
   way of specifying the contact point?)

   Riemer (2015) has a way of describing 'contact' point.
** TODO Ponder replacing 'toward' and 'away from' with converge/diverge
   Explore/ponder/research the fact that the modifier symbols '--> <--' and
   '<-- -->' (which are written under circling, curving, hitting, twisting)
   could maybe be better written with converging and diverging symbols
   underneath the symbol it modifies.
** [0/4] Glyph list filtering
*** TODO Go through handshape symbols in 'my' lexicon
    To verify which handshapes are actually used in the web lexicon.
*** TODO Add missing symbols from 1994 source to position table
    Duplicated symbols are not listed in the book appendix (except for the
    chest). Go through the transcriptions in the book and include the missing
    symbols: the eyes, ears, cheeks, shoulders and/or hips.

    Also look for left ear, cheek or hip, and include those as well (if they
    exist in the book).
*** TODO Add source info for position table
*** TODO Add source info for articulation table
** TODO Reference section should which sources are derivatives of other
   There should be comments describing that the following works are basically
   variations on *the exact the same text*, with only some minor updates. (This
   is especially important almost all of the example transcriptions given are
   retained, even though many of them are no longer to be found in the
   lexicon.)

** TODO All mentions of a reference should link to relevant reference section
** TODO Add symbol descriptions from "Kompendium in teckensprÃ¥kstranskription"
   Symbols for "lilla A-handen" etc. that occur in this source should be
   included in the article.
** TODO Include transcription of words especially interesting words
   'camera' makes use of passive + active hand + body position. That this can
   occur (and how) should be described in the transcription rules somehow.
   http://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/ord/03672

   'setback' (fÃ¥ tji/fÃ¥ bakslag) is singed in an odd way, and the passive hand
   sort of has a body position, but the sign isn't transcribed that way in the
   lexicon: http://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/ord/00497 -- Is there even a way
   to understand the sign from the current transcription in the lexicon?
** TODO Source citations (<details>) should be more clearly delineated
   Currently is kinda hard to see difference between an expanded source
   citation and the surrounding text, maybe put a border or something around
   it?
** TODO Improve top-right expand/collapse buttons
   Instead of having two buttons, there should be only one which should (in a
   fashion similar to org-mode) cycle through the modes:

     + Everything collapsed (default)
     + All <details> without the 'closed' attribute opened
     + ALL <details> opened

   Mouseover text should clearly state what will happen upon the next click.

    elsewhere.)
*** TODO Add symbol 'repeated signeme' (1977)
    Only used in Bergman (1977), example given on page 129. â Looks like a
    slash through a colon (a slash with one dot above and one below the middle
    line of the slash, similar to the music notation 'one bar repeat' symbol).
*** TODO Add symbol 'angled index finger' (1982â1994)

*** TODO Add symbol 'NO hand'/'bent N hand' (1989â1994)
    Hedberg (1989) calls this the NO hand', Bergman & BjÃ¶rkstrand (1993) uses
    the name 'bent index N hand'. â Looks like an 'O' with a small capital 'N'
    written inside it.
*** TODO Add symbol 'LO hand'/'bent index finger' (1989â1994)
    First used in Hedberg (1989) where it is called the 'LO hand', Bergman &
    BjÃ¶rkstrand (1993) rename it 'bent index finger', and it is last seen in
    Wallin (1994) which also calls it 'bent index finger'. â Looks like an 'O'
    with a small capital 'L' written inside it.
*** TODO Add symbol 'angled rooster hand' (1989)
    Only used in Hedberg (1989). â Looks like the 'straight measure hand', with

    upwards pointing arrow.
*** TODO Add symbol 'bent spread hand' (1994)

   (since both keyboard and magnifier icon in <textarea> can be brightened
   now).
*** DONE `keyboard.js` shouldn't insert button element into textarea
    The virtual keyboard icon button should be present in the basic HTML, so
    that the behavior of that button can be defined in the base CSS of the
    page. Only the DOM element with the virtual keyboard itself should be
    inserted by `keyboard.js`.

    This avoids having the DOM being updated late in the load cycle (causing
    repaints after rest of page has loaded).
*** DONE Virtual keyboard buttons should not submit query
    Pressing a button on the virtual keyboard (with space, enter or mouse
    click) should result in that symbol being inserted in the textarea (without
    submitting the form).
*** DONE Escape should toggle virtual keyboard
    This should work in textarea, on textarea button in the virtual keyboard.
*** DONE Textarea: Enter should submit
*** DONE Keyboard icon: Space/enter/escape/click should toggle keyboard
*** DONE Virtual button: Enter/space/click should insert symbol in textarea
** DONE Lexicon: Don't show tooltips if pointer is outside element
   CLOSED: [2019-07-17 Wed 19:42]
   Currently a tooltip is displayed even if the mouse pointer only passed
   through an element with a `data-title` attribute and then stopped. However
   tooltip should only be displayed if (a) the element is still shown on the
   page (ie if the element was part of a menu or overlay that has since
   disappeared from the screen the tooldip should not be shown and (b) mouse
   pointer is still hovering on the element in question (ie if the mouse
   pointer only passed through the element but stops outside the element the
   tooltip should not be displayed).
** DONE Lexicon: Hide tooltips on window resize
   CLOSED: [2019-07-16 Tue 04:40]
   It looks kinda strange when the tooltip stays in place, when stuff
   underneath moves away and when the tooltip resizes itself if it's cut off by
   the right window border.
** DONE Lexicon: Make video/text toggle focusable & hilite on hover
   CLOSED: [2019-07-15 Mon 05:30]
   + Make it focusable (so that one can enable/disable using keyboard).
   + Currently the `search-brief` element is rendered with `opacity: .5`
     meaning that the focus shadow is too dim. Use 'color: #888` (and adjust
     other colors) instead.

** [5/5] Remove old import files
   Before April 2018 the database was manually updated based on a special .tab
   sent to me by the Swedish Sign Language Lexicon office. Before that I used
   web scraping of teckensprakslexikon.su.se. Since this hasn't been true for a
   great long while these old files should be cleaned away.

*** DONE Remove 'svtsplex-export.tab' (lexicon export file, now unused)
    CLOSED: [2019-07-11 Thu 15:18]

*** DONE Search for non-alphabet character should match better (eg 'ô¥ ')
    CLOSED: [2019-07-06 Sat 23:04]
    '[' should not require '*[*' to match in '[HYFF]'

    This should not require that the search term is part of a word. Same goes
    for search for " ", maybe? (or does a search for '*" "*' make more sense?)

** DONE Lexicon help: Close overlay when clicking search example link
   CLOSED: [2019-07-06 Sat 20:39]

   * = match 'word' characters (i.e. not space and segment separator, 'ô¥ ', but
     everything else)

   Useful (complex) query:
   ô¥§ ô¦ô¥ -ô¥  -#:#: -:##: -ô¦*ô¦  -@

   Transcriptions are fiddly and finicky, rather than spending time on
   inputting a transcription, search for a sign that you know is similar to the
   one you're looking for, then copy/paste the transcription of that sign into
   the search field and replace parts you're not sure about with asterisks
   ('*').

   If you get too many matches, the following search terms can be useful for
   ignoring some of them:

     -:##: -- exclude signs with two active hands
     -#:#: -- exclude signs with one active, one passive hand
     -@    -- exclude signs a body position
     -ô¥     -- exclude signs with more than one segment
     -ô¥ *ô¥   -- exclude signs with more than two segments
     :##:  -- include only signs with two active hands
     #:#:  -- include only signs with one active, one passive hand
     @     -- include only signs which have a body position

   Display signs that contain a downward motion, and a handshape transition to
   the spread hand (sprethanden), but that does not contain multiple segments
   (-ô¥ ), two handed segments (excluding those with a passive secondary hand
   with -#:#:, and those with an active secondary hand with -:##:), more than
   one handshape transition, or a specified position (-@).

   CLOSED: [2018-08-22 Wed 19:56]
   Originally intended to add a progress bar for the search itself as searching

   Frustrating!

   In my attempts make the search function asynchronous to allow for the
   progress bar updating, I accidentally discovered that using a `for` loop
   (rather than the previous `reduce`) resulted in 20 *millisecond* search
   times instead of the previous 2 seconds!

   Need for progress bar therefore eliminated!

    One should be able to use the table checkboxes for selecting what to

    These should work so that, when checked, all items with that attribute are
    displayed (but no other).

    If multiple checkboxes are marked, they should be AND:ed together.

** DONE Progress bar during search result update
   CLOSED: [2017-12-31 Sun 11:18]
   The search is always very fast, but displaying results takes time when there
   are a lot of entries found... Is there a way to speed this up?

   NO -- I did some research/experiments with various ways of updating the DOM,
   but couldn't find any method that was significantly faster than the one
   currently used.

   Rewrote the updating so a search resulting in 500 matches will be displayed
   is the same way as before, but if there are more matches than that, then
   each additional chunk of 500 matches will be added chuck-by-chunk (with a
   progress bar at the top of the page indicating how many chunks to go).
** DONE Make lexicon search case-insensitive
   CLOSED: [2017-12-25 Mon 01:58]
   Some words in the dictionary have upper case letters in their definition,
   these upper case letters cannot be matched in a search. (Since the query is
   translated to lowercase, and only lower case is searched for.)
