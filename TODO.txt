* TODO Add '/' sign
* TODO Remove '=>' arrow from IIIa list of glyphs
* TODO Sign transcript should be inside another table
  With one <td> for I, one for II and one for II fields.
* TODO Buttons should reflect possible clusters
  I buttons should be disabled if one of them has been used (since only one
  place of articulation is possible).

  Ib should be disabled if IIa is in use (they're mutually exclusive).

  IIa should be disabled if Ib is in use (they're mutually exclusive).

  IIb should be disabled unless IIa is in use.
* TODO Use infinite undo paradigm
  Instead of ok/cancel requesters. All changes should be automatically written
  to localStorage.
* TODO Modified/unmodified detection on load/save
* TODO Add separator between transcriptions
* TODO 'Share' URLs with all transcript information
  The URL should contain all information required to build a transcript (so
  that one may link to them).
* TODO Drag-and-drop clusters to reorder them
* [10/14] Cell phone friendly glyph selector
  Instead of using <- and -> to change glyphs, should press enter (or click) to
  get a dropdown from which one can select a glyph. -- This would also make
  this work on cell phones.

* [7/9] Fix bad/missing glyphs
** TODO What to do with the (so far) unused glyphs?
   Files matching `pic/**/*Truetrans*.svg`.

   Haven't found much documentation about what these glyphs actually mean, or
   if they're used, but some of them occur in the Swedish Sign Language
   dictionary, and there's very brief descriptions of them in the compendium of
   the sign language typeface.
** TODO "Handform – Krokfingret" should have thicker lines
   Currently this glyph has thinner lines than all the other glyphs. That
   doesn't look nice. :(
** DONE "Läge – Höfterna" is to wide                                :WONTFIX:
   CLOSED: [2016-11-17 Thu 18:42]
   Now works quite well when using proportional glyphs.

* DONE Round off CCS pixel to integers
  CLOSED: [2016-11-17 Thu 19:03]
* [6/6] Resize image bounding boxes
  The size of each image should be just enough for the glyph to fit, and then
  each image should be included in the DOM not as background images using CSS,
  but as proper images with the <img> tag -- that way the HTML tables can
  adjust automatically to each glyph's size and we'll get a (much?) prettier
  layout of each transcribed sign.

* DONE Preload all images
  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:31]
  Load them using HTML, rather than ajax, if possible (as it would work on the
  file:// protocol, too). Maybe just a large hidden HTML element will do?
* DONE Focus the a new cluster upon creation
  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:04]
  BUG: Implementation doesn't work when adding prepended type I field, if other
  clusters have already been created. -- It then focuses a glyph in the last
  cluster instead. But what the hell, right?

  When one clicks a button to create a new glyph cluster, that cluster should
  be focused.
* DONE 'Delete' button
  CLOSED: [2016-11-06 Sun 20:17]
  For erasing a saved transcription.
* DONE 'Clear' button
  CLOSED: [2016-11-06 Sun 17:29]
  For clearing the current transcription.
* DONE 'Articulation' should be as high as 'relation'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 19:13]
  All articulations (including separator and repetition) should be higher on
  the line, so as to be clearly distinguishable. In fact the top of these
  should align with the top of 'R' (relation).
* DONE Change CSS unit 'em' -> 'px'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 17:33]
  There are rounding errors causing some ugliness and uneven sizes of stuff.
* DONE I. Add 'Place of articulation' symbols at beginning
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 03:40]
  The I type buttons should add their symbol at the beginning of the
  transcript, rather than at the end.
* [7/7] Give glyph SVG files descriptive names
  Instead of the pseudo-random names they inherited from the typefaces.

* DONE 'Interaction kind' component of IIa should be optional
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 11:19]
  Double articulation cluster IIa should have an optional interaction kind.
* DONE Hand position glyphs should rotate clockwards
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 20:34]
  'AR' and 'AV' glyphs should be reordered so that they rotate clockwards as
  one steps through them.
* DONE Display optional 'interaction kind' component of IIa better
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 12:03]
  It should only take up space in the glyph when it is actually used.
* DONE Remember last saved
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 22:33]
  On reload, the transcription loaded before the reload should be the one
  displayed.
* DONE Named saves
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 14:44]
  Should allow for saving of multiple transcriptions with different names, so
  that we can transcribe a buncha stuff and see what works.
* DONE Three articulation buttons
