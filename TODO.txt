* TODO Transkription beskriven av länk
  En URL ska kunna innehålla allt som behövs för att kunna visa en
  transkription.
* TODO Drag-and-drop clusters to reorder them
* TODO Change glyphs by selecting from table
  Instead of using <- and -> to change glyphs, should press enter (or click) to
  get a chart from which one can select a glyph. -- This would also make this
  work on cell phones.
* TODO Shortcuts for hand shape glyphs
  Pressing an alphabetic key should jump to the glyph most similar i
  appearance = Faster navigation!
* TODO Focusing glyph should update status box
  Displaying the information about that glyph.
* TODO Resize image bounding boxes
  The size of each image should be just enough for the glyph to fit, and then
  each image should be included in the DOM not as background images using CSS,
  but as proper images with the <img> tag -- that way the HTML tables can
  adjust automatically to each glyph's size and we'll get a (much?) prettier
  layout of each transcribed sign.
* TODO Import/export saved data
* [1/2] Simple articulation field
** TODO Move 'medial contact'(?) and 'contact' symbols to separator
   'Medial contact' and 'contact' are dots and therefore narrower and would go
   better with the separator button (for typographical reasons).

   Is 'medial contact' meant to be wider? I.e. have space on each sides? If so,
   retain it where it currently is.
** DONE Three buttons

* [6/9] Fix bad/missing glyphs
** TODO What to do with the (so far) unused glyphs?
   Files matching `pic/**/*Truetrans*.svg`.
** TODO "Läge – Höfterna" is to wide
   pic/six_Truetrans1.svg

   Compare this with "Läge – Axlarna" [pic/greater_Truetrans1.svg] (same
   symbol, but upside down) which is centered better.
** TODO "Handform – Krokfingret" should have thicker lines
   Currently this glyph has thinner lines than all the other glyphs. That
   doesn't look nice. :(
** DONE "Läge – Ögat" should be lowered

* DONE Preload all images
  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:31]
  Load them using HTML, rather than ajax, if possible (as it would work on the
  file:// protocol, too). Maybe just a large hidden HTML element will do?
* DONE Focus the a new cluster upon creation
  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:04]
  BUG: Implementation doesn't work when adding prepended type I field, if other
  clusters have already been created. -- It then focuses a glyph in the last
  cluster instead. But what the hell, right?

  When one clicks a button to create a new glyph cluster, that cluster should
  be focused.
* DONE 'Delete' button
  CLOSED: [2016-11-06 Sun 20:17]
  For erasing a saved transcription.
* DONE 'Clear' button
  CLOSED: [2016-11-06 Sun 17:29]
  For clearing the current transcription.
* DONE 'Articulation' should be as high as 'relation'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 19:13]
  All articulations (including separator and repetition) should be higher on
  the line, so as to be clearly distinguishable. In fact the top of these
  should align with the top of 'R' (relation).
* DONE Change CSS unit 'em' -> 'px'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 17:33]
  There are rounding errors causing some ugliness and uneven sizes of stuff.
* DONE I. Add 'Place of articulation' symbols at beginning
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 03:40]
  The I type buttons should add their symbol at the beginning of the
  transcript, rather than at the end.
* [7/7] Give glyph SVG files descriptive names
  Instead of the pseudo-random names they inherited from the typefaces.

  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 11:19]
  Double articulation cluster IIa should have an optional interaction kind.
* DONE Hand position glyphs should rotate clockwards
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 20:34]
  'AR' and 'AV' glyphs should be reordered so that they rotate clockwards as
  one steps through them.
* DONE Display optional 'interaction kind' component of IIa better
  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 12:03]
  It should only take up space in the glyph when it is actually used.
* DONE Remember last saved
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 22:33]
  On reload, the transcription loaded before the reload should be the one
  displayed.
* DONE Named saves
  CLOSED: [2016-11-02 Wed 14:44]
  Should allow for saving of multiple transcriptions with different names, so
  that we can transcribe a buncha stuff and see what works.
