* TODO Display optional 'interaction kind' component of IIa better
  It should only take up space in the glyph when it is actually used.
* TODO Shortcuts for hand shape glyphs
* TODO Focusing glyph should update status box
  Displaying the information about that glyph.
* TODO Resize image bounding boxes
  The size of each image should be just enough for the glyph to fit, and then
  each image should be included in the DOM not as background images using CSS,
  but as proper images with the <img> tag -- that way the HTML tables can
  adjust automatically to each glyph's size and we'll get a (much?) prettier
  layout of each transcribed sign.
* TODO Rename images to something logical
  Instead of the pseudo-random names they inherited from the typefaces.
* TODO Delete function
  For erasing a saved transcription.
* TODO 'Clear' button
  For clearing the current transcription.
* TODO Import/export saved data
* [1/2] Simple articulation field
** TODO Move 'medial contact'(?) and 'contact' symbols to separator
   'Medial contact' and 'contact' are dots and therefore narrower and would go
   better with the separator button (for typographical reasons).

   Is 'medial contact' meant to be wider? I.e. have space on each sides? If so,
   retain it where it currently is.
** DONE Three buttons

  that we can transcribe a buncha stuff and see what works.
