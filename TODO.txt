* TODO Fix '<' '>' and 'x' buttons for III glyphs
* TODO Update 'status' field when hovering on glyph
* TODO Add '/' sign
* TODO GUI prettifications
** TODO Hovering on cluster should hilite corresponding button
** TODO Hovering on button should display effects of button
   E.g. if button insert something into transcript, this should be displayed
   but grayed out, if button is clicked this grayed out image should solidify
   and remain.
* TODO Buttons should reflect possible clusters
  I buttons should be disabled if one of them has been used (since only one
  place of articulation is possible).

  Ib should be disabled if IIa is in use (they're mutually exclusive).

  IIa should be disabled if Ib is in use (they're mutually exclusive).

  IIb should be disabled unless IIa is in use.
* TODO Use infinite undo paradigm
  Instead of ok/cancel requesters. All changes should be automatically written
  to localStorage.
* TODO Modified/unmodified detection on load/save
* TODO Add separator between transcriptions
* TODO 'Share' URLs with all transcript information
  The URL should contain all information required to build a transcript (so
  that one may link to them).

  Cluster separator: '.'
  Transcription separator: '/' ?

  Example: #oOE.OUH0AOHU.OUHho/oeh.A2Oc.ShuE0o

  .,_-

  Use: [A-Za-z] (52 possible; [A-Za-z0-9+/] is base64)

  * Encode each list as [A-Za-z]

  Pseudo code:

        if three components
            process 1st (place of articulation)
        fi
        process remaining two


  I: Place of articulation is one of:

      R        H       AR      AV
      [A-Za-z]?[A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z]

  (3 or 4 bytes.)

  or

      R        A
      [A-Za-z]?[A-Za-z]

  (1 or 2 bytes.)

  II: Articulator

      (optional left hand)
      R        H       AR      AV
      [A-Za-z]?[A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z]

  (0 or 3-4 bytes.)

      (optional interaction)
      I
      0[A-Za-z]?

  (0 or 2 bytes.)

      H       AR      AV
      [A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z]

  (3 bytes.)

  III: Articulation
  Any number of [A-Za-z] plus [0-5][A-Za-z].

  - 0 is '=>', followed by 'H' glyph
  - 1-4 is 'båge/cirkel/vrids/slås' followed by A-Za-z

* TODO Position of 'contact'/'medial contact' glyphs in selector
* TODO Export transcription as SVG (?)                           :FAR_FUTURE:
  Is this possible? Maybe composing an SVG based on the individual glyphs plus
  their relative coordinates taken from the DOM might be possible using some
  Javascript SVG library.
* TODO Direction of movement above medial contact symbol
  "Medial contact must be combined with a direction of movement. The direction
  symbol is placed above the symbol for medial contact." [Teckentranskription,
  p.10]
* TODO Inline all SVG
  Allows for:
  + Using CSS to control SVG color (yay!) and
  + Fewer requests to fetch the app.

  Concatenate all SVGs into one HTML blob, and inline them in the main HTML in
  a <div style="display:none">.

  The class name of each SVG should be the same as the current file name, then
  use some jQuery magic to extract it and inserting it in the relevant place.
* [1/3] CSS class indicating table cell position in input
** DONE 'high'/'mid'/'low' - For small symbols in high/mid/low position.
   CLOSED: [2016-11-18 Fri 10:51]
** TODO 'text' - For text like symbols (handshape and place of articulation).
** TODO 'full' - For full height table cells.
* [7/9] Fix bad/missing glyphs
** TODO What to do with the (so far) unused glyphs?
   Files matching `pic/**/*Truetrans*.svg`.

   Haven't found much documentation about what these glyphs actually mean, or
   if they're used, but some of them occur in the Swedish Sign Language
   dictionary, and there's very brief descriptions of them in the compendium of
   the sign language typeface.
** TODO "Handform – Krokfingret" should have thicker lines
   Currently this glyph has thinner lines than all the other glyphs. That
   doesn't look nice. :(
** DONE "Läge – Höfterna" is to wide                                :WONTFIX:

* DONE Cleanup terminology in source code
  CLOSED: [2016-12-08 Thu 15:53]
  + 'image' = Refers to one SVG (or other) image (which usually contains a
    single glyph).
  + 'glyph' = One symbol (or squiggle) used.
  + 'cluster' (of glyphs) = A collection of glyphs which always go together.
    (In the GUI there is a button for each cluster.)
  + 'transcript' = A complete transcript for a single sign.
* DONE BUGFIX: Cluster buttons on top of glyph selector
  CLOSED: [2016-11-29 Tue 10:23]
  Fixed this by adding the class 'overlay' to the <body> tag when displaying
  the overlay, and then having a CSS rule hiding the move/delete buttons if the
  overlay class is applied to body.

  The cluster move/delete buttons should now show up on top of the glyph
  selector menu.
* DONE Glyph selector order
  CLOSED: [2016-11-29 Tue 10:13]
  Should reflect the order in 'Teckentranskription' (rather than be in an order
  convenient when stepping through the glyphs one by one, as before).
* DONE Remove '=>' arrow from IIIa list of glyphs
  CLOSED: [2016-11-29 Tue 09:41]
* DONE Glyph selector mobile cancel
  CLOSED: [2016-11-28 Mon 19:04]
  Use page history to allow the 'Back' button to cancel.
* [14/14] Cell phone friendly glyph selector
  Instead of using <- and -> to change glyphs, should press enter (or click) to
  get a dropdown from which one can select a glyph. -- This would also make
  this work on cell phones.

* DONE Glyph selector shouldn't split rows with borders
  CLOSED: [2016-11-22 Tue 20:30]
  When showing the glyph selector on a cell phone, the fact that one selects an
  entire table row is not obvious (one could get the impression that one can
  select table *cells*).

  Should remove the vertical lines (vertical table cell borders) inside the
  table, so at to emphasize that the description on each line is denotes one
  possible glyph (and not several alternatives).
* DONE Cell phone friendly CSS
  CLOSED: [2016-11-22 Tue 19:52]
  Responsive GUI when zooming in on cell phone.

* DONE Round off CCS pixel to integers
  CLOSED: [2016-11-17 Thu 19:03]
* [6/6] Resize image bounding boxes
  The size of each image should be just enough for the glyph to fit, and then
  each image should be included in the DOM not as background images using CSS,
  but as proper images with the <img> tag -- that way the HTML tables can
  adjust automatically to each glyph's size and we'll get a (much?) prettier
  layout of each transcribed sign.

  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:31]
  Load them using HTML, rather than ajax, if possible (as it would work on the

* DONE Focus the a new cluster upon creation
  CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:04]
  BUG: Implementation doesn't work when adding prepended type I field, if other
  clusters have already been created. -- It then focuses a glyph in the last
  cluster instead. But what the hell, right?

  When one clicks a button to create a new glyph cluster, that cluster should
  be focused.

  For clearing the current transcription.
* DONE 'Articulation' should be as high as 'relation'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 19:13]
  All articulations (including separator and repetition) should be higher on
  the line, so as to be clearly distinguishable. In fact the top of these
  should align with the top of 'R' (relation).
* DONE Change CSS unit 'em' -> 'px'
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 17:33]
  There are rounding errors causing some ugliness and uneven sizes of stuff.
* DONE I. Add 'Place of articulation' symbols at beginning
  CLOSED: [2016-11-04 Fri 03:40]
  The I type buttons should add their symbol at the beginning of the
  transcript, rather than at the end.

  CLOSED: [2016-11-03 Thu 20:34]
